### Skills I am Practicing With this Project

This project focuses mainly on implementing a simple set of basic HTML skills. It uses typical boilerplate and semantic elements including headings, lists, paragraphs, images, and text emphasis. Outside the scope of The Odin Project's [project specification](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes), I apply some minor CSS styling for presentation, including setting the body color, centering the home page recipe images, applying some margin/padding. Nothing crazy.

I also practiced gathering [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/) assets and proper attribution. I saved images of the food I write about and gave credit according to the license requirements. I resized the imaged to a standard aspect ratio using GIMP in Linux.
